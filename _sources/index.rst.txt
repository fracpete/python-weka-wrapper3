   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Introduction
============

*python-weka-wrapper3* allows you to use `Weka <http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/>`__ from within Python3.

The library uses the `javabridge <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/javabridge>`__ library for starting up,
communicating with and shutting down the Java Virtual Machine in which the Weka processes get executed.

*python-weka-wrapper3* provides a thin wrapper around the basic (non-GUI) functionality of Weka (some plots are
available using Python functionality). You can automatically add all your Weka packages to the classpath.
Additional jars can be added as well.
